#+TITLE: Interface for Yubikey OTP Access in Emacs

* Description
An Emacs package for copying OATH codes from a YubiKey.
* Dependencies
The ~ykman~ program, which is included in the YubiKey Manager program by Yubico.
* Usage
1. M-x ~ykman-mode-query-code~
2. Input YubiKey password
3. Select account
4. Tap Yubikey
* Notes
Only tested on Windows with a password protected YubiKey. This has been working for me personally but I can't guarantee complete robustness
* Further Developments
This package could be expanded by implementing a way to set up new OATH codes.
